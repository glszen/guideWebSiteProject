# Website Overview

This README provides an overview of the basic structure of a website with multiple pages and navigation. The website consists of the following pages:

- Home Page (`Index.html`)
- About Page (`About.html`)
- Services Page (`Services.html`)
- Contact Page (`Contact.html`)

## General Structure

The website includes an `index.html` page and at least three sub-pages. Each page follows the HTML5 document structure with `<head>` and `<body>` sections.

- Each page includes the `<meta charset="UTF-8">` tag for proper character encoding.
- The `<title>` tag is used within the `<head>` section to define the page's title.

## Navigation Menu

- A navigation menu is placed at the top of each page.
- The menu includes links to at least four pages:
    - Home
    - About
    - Services
    - Contact

## Home Page (`Index.html`)

- The home page includes a main heading (`<h1>`) that clearly defines the website's purpose.
- A few paragraphs (`<p>`) are added to provide an introductory text.
- At least one image (`<img>`) is included, with an appropriate alt attribute.
- An ordered (`<ol>`) or unordered list (`<ul>`) is used to list key points or services.

## About Page (`About.html`)

- The About page contains a heading (`<h2>`) and a few paragraphs (`<p>`) providing information about the company or the individual.
- An ordered list (`<ol>`) is used to present important dates or milestones, such as the founding year or major events.

## Services Page (`Services.html`)

- The Services page lists the offered services.
- Each service is described with a heading (`<h2>`) and a paragraph (`<p>`).
- An unordered list (`<ul>`) is used to display the various services.

## Contact Page (`Contact.html`)

- The Contact page provides a heading (`<h2>`) with contact details.
- A paragraph (`<p>`) describes how users can reach out.
- An unordered list (`<ul>`) is used to present contact information such as address, phone, and email.
- A contact form (`<form>`) is included, with fields for name, email, and message. Note: No backend processing is required for this form as only HTML is used.

## Conclusion

This website structure follows the basic principles of HTML5, providing clear and organized content across multiple pages. The design includes a navigation menu to easily navigate between sections and pages.
